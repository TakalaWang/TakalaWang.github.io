# About Me

Hello, welcome everyone who clicked here! I am **Chung-Chun Wang**, or you can also call me **Takala**!

I am currently graduating from the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Taiwan Normal University, and will soon be entering the Institute of Computer Science at NYCU.
My main research areas are Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and I will be switching to computer vision in graduate school.
In terms of development, I mainly focus on web front-end and back-end, along with some small personal projects.

I love puzzles, music, and drama, and I also enjoy reading mystery novels.
I am a lifelong cat lover and milk tea enthusiast.
Also, I am a loyal fan of [SLSMusic](https://www.youtube.com/@SLSMusic) (If you like piano music, go listen! Highly recommended!).
I am also a beginner in badminton, hoping to get stronger in the future.

My life goal is to achieve financial freedom as soon as possible, so I can spend my days working on little programs I love and contributing to education by promoting computer science knowledge.
Here, I will mainly share various thoughts and experiences, possibly including some technical discussions or my random musings. In the near future, I might start by updating my escape room recommendations list.
If you have any questions, feel free to [contact me](mailto:ccwangtakala@gmail.com). As an active internet user, I usually reply instantly, so no need to worry about not finding me.
