# About Me

Hello, welcome everyone who clicked here! I am **Chung-Chun Wang**, or you can also call me **Takala**!

I am currently a graduate student at the Institute of Computer Science, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.
My main research areas are Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and I switched to computer vision in graduate school.
In terms of development, I mainly focus on web front-end and back-end, along with some small tools to make my work easier.

I love puzzles, music, and drama, and I also enjoy reading mystery novels.
I am a lifelong cat lover and milk tea enthusiast.
Also, I am a loyal fan of [SLSMusic](https://www.youtube.com/@SLSMusic) (If you like piano music, go listen! Highly recommended!).
I am also a beginner in badminton, hoping to get stronger in the future.

My life goal is to achieve financial freedom as soon as possible, so I can spend my days working on little programs I love and contributing to education by promoting computer science knowledge.
Here, I will mainly share various thoughts and experiences, possibly including some technical discussions or my random musings. In the near future, I might start by updating my escape room recommendations list.
If you have any questions, feel free to [contact me](mailto:ccwangtakala@gmail.com). As an active internet user, I usually reply instantly, so no need to worry about not finding me.
